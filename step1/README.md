## How to use

In order to use this app you need to have docker running on your computer. Than you need a terminal open with the this directory as the working directory. You will than run this command (The parts between \[square brackets\] are for you to fill in and the parts in {curly brackets} are optional) :  
`docker build -t [IMAGE NAME] .`  
You than need to run this command :  
`docker run {--name [CONTAINER NAME]} -d -p [PORT]:80 [IMAGE NAME]`  
This runs the container is the background on the chosen port and eventually gives it a meaningful name if you chose to. Now you only need to connect to `localhost:[PORT]` and you will be connected to your static HTTP server

## Configuration doc

We have a content file which is just a static example internet page found for free on the internet. The Dockerfile simply copies the content file at the right place of an Apache app in order to access it.
